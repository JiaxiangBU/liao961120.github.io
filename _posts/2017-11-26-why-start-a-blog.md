There are many reasons to start a blog. I was inspired by [this post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/advice-to-aspiring-data-scientists-start-a-blog/) and my interest in psychology. 

## Starting a Blog for Others
I have been reluctant to share my ideas with others(partly because I'm shy), <!--more-->but my interest in the evolutionary origin of human psychology led me to realize the importance of learning and cultural transmission in our species[1]. A hard-working but not-so-smart student can do much better than a genius who never learn. 

I'm a not-so-smart student, and have spent a large amount of time figuring out many simple things while learning. I could have learned more effectively if someone had shared their experience. Now, I am a guy with some experience, and maybe I can share it to others so that they can learn more effectively.

## Starting a Blog for Myself
Probably, no or few people will read the posts on my blog. But as noted in [the post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/advice-to-aspiring-data-scientists-start-a-blog/) I mentioned in the begining, **writing posts is a great chance to practice skills and communicating about it**. By sharing what I've learned through writing a post about it, I'm actually reviewing it. And by communicating about what I've learned, I can know how well I understand the topic(thinking that you understand is different from understanding itself).

## Notes
1. I think we cannot fully understand the evolution of human psychology without considering the effect of culture.
