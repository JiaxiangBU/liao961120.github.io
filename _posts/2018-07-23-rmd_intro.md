I've used [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) to do lots of work, such as writing a [book](/MVA/), doing homework on [statistics](/notes/106-2/multivariate/) and [ecology](/notes/106-2/Eco_model/spatial_model.html), making [slides](/notes/rmd_features.html#12_beamer_slide_(pdf))
, and even [web pages](https://twlangsurvey.github.io/main/).
