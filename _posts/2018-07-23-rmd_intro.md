I've used [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) to do lots of work, such as writing a [book](/MVA/), doing homework on [statistics](/notes/106-2/multivariate/) and [ecology](/notes/106-2/Eco_model/spatial_model.html), and making [web pages](https://twlangsurvey.github.io/main/).

The above mentioned are all HTML output formats from R Markdown, but PDF output formats are also possible, such as this [Beamer Slide](/notes/rmd_features.html#12_beamer_slide) and my [term paper](https://github.com/liao961120/local_depend/blob/master/1062_class/anthro_final) on cultural anthropology.

Because of doing so much work with R Markdown, I write down some of the most common and useful features of R Markdown so I can look it up when I need to[^note]. I also make it available to everyone by putting the [document](/notes/rmd_features.html) on my blog.

## Footnotes

[^note]: Since it is intended for **quick lookup**, the document is very compact. That means you need to have some basic knowledge on R Markdown to be able to understand all of it. For more thorough documents on R Markdown, see the [last section](#other-resources-of-r-markdown) of this post.
