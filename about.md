Hi, I'm Y.-F. Liao, a psychology major at NTU. I'm fascinated by the evolutionary origin of human behaviour, and this fascination have driven me to study a broad range of interesting subjects. This is a place where I share my notes on learning. I would also share some personal experience of learning that (I think) can benefit the audience. You can read [Why Start a Blog?](https://liao961120.github.io/2017/11/26/why-start-a-blog.html) to better understand me.

----------------------
### Language
I'll try my best to make my blog English to reach a wider range of potential audiance, and to force myself to write in English. Some of the posts will be written in Chinese for the intended audiance, and some written bilingually(if I have enough leisure time to do so).
