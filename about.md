### Interests and Motivation
Hi, I'm Y.-F. Liao, a psychology major at NTU. I'm fascinated by human evolution, particularly the (possible) dynamics of culture-gene coevolutionary process, which I believe had led to some of the most distinctive characteristics of human psychologies. This fascination has driven me to study a broad range of interesting subjects, and also gave me an insight about the importance of transmitting idea, knowledge, and experience. 

This is a place where I share my notes and some personal experience on learning. You can read my post, [Why Start a Blog?](https://liao961120.github.io/2017/11/26/why-start-a-blog.html), to have a better understanding of  my incentive.

----------------------
### Language
I'll try to make my blog English to reach a wider range of potential audiance (and it's also convenient since many of my notes were originally taken in English). Some posts will be written in Chinese for the intended audience, and some even bilingually (if I have enough leisure time to do so).
