## Interests and Motivation

I'm a psychology major strongly interested in human evolution, particularly the (possible) interactions of culture and genetic evolution, which I believe had led to some of the most distinctive features of human psychologies. This interest has driven me to study a range of interesting subjects in addition to psychology, such as prehistory, genetics, and evolution. This interest has also given me an insight about the importance of transmitting idea, knowledge, and experience to others in human societies.

## Posts

This is a place where I share my notes and some personal experience on learning. You can read my post, [Why Start a Blog?](https://liao961120.github.io/2017/11/26/why-start-a-blog.html){:target="_blank"}, to have a better understanding of  my incentive.

Some of the posts might not be complete and might not be readable since they are just quick drafts, which I didn't have time to turn them into complete posts. These posts might be helpful, however, if you already have some idea hinted by the post titles.


## Language

Some of the posts were written in Chinese, and some in English since many of my notes were originally taken in English. Some posts might be written in both Chinese and English if I have enough time to do so. Note however that I'm not a native speaker of English, so please bear with the grammatical errors if you encountered some.
