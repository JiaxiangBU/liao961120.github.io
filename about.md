#### Interests and Motivation
Hi, I'm Y.-F. Liao, a psychology major at NTU. I'm strongly interested in human evolution, particularly the (possible) dynamics of culture-gene coevolutionary process, which I believe had led to some of the most distinctive features of human psychologies. This interest has driven me to study a broad range of interesting subjects, and also gave me an insight about the importance of transmitting idea, knowledge, and experience.

This is a place where I share my notes and some personal experience on learning. You can read my post, [Why Start a Blog?](https://liao961120.github.io/2017/11/26/why-start-a-blog.html), to have a better understanding of  my incentive.


#### Language

Some of the posts would be written in Chinese, and some in English since many of my notes were originally taken in English. Some posts might be written in both Chinese and English if I have enough time to do so. Note however that I'm not a native speaker of English, so please bear with the grammatical errors if you encountered some.
