### Me
Hi, I'm Y.-F. Liao, a psychology major at NTU. I'm fascinated by the possiblity of applying evolutionary theory to explain human behaviour, and this fascination has driven me to study a broad range of interesting subjects. This is a place where I share my notes and some personal experience on learning. You can read my post, [Why Start a Blog?](https://liao961120.github.io/2017/11/26/why-start-a-blog.html), to better understand my incentive.

----------------------
### Language
I'll try to make my blog English to reach a wider range of potential audiance (and it's also convenient since many of my notes were originally taken in English). Some posts will be written in Chinese for the intended audience, and some even bilingually (if I have enough leisure time to do so).
